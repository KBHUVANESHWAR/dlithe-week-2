    <div class="over"><p>The customer base of the company grew during the 1970s, when mini-computers were introduced alongside the existing mainframe computers. Besides mainframe computer services and software, the development of IT systems was also central to the operations of Tietotehdas. Customers represented several industries and operations were organized according to these verticals. During the 1990s, the company experienced rapid growth through a number of acquisitions, mergers and strategic alliances. In December 1995, Tietotehdas acquired the Finnish state computer centre (VTKK-Yhtym√§ Oy). The new company was named TT Tieto Oy</p></div>
